This project is a good example of you can write UI Automation tests using Page OBject Design pattern.

The Page Object Design Pattern is a widely used architectural pattern in UI automation that enhances test maintenance and readability. This pattern involves creating a class for each web page or UI component in an application, encapsulating the pageâ€™s elements and actions within that class. By doing so, the pattern provides a clear separation between the test logic and the UI details.

In practice, a Page Object class represents a specific page or component, containing methods that interact with the elements of that page, such as filling out forms, clicking buttons, or retrieving information. These methods abstract away the complexity of element locators and interactions, allowing test scripts to focus solely on the functionality being tested.

This approach offers several advantages. It promotes reusability by centralizing the code that interacts with a page, which simplifies updates when the UI changes. It also improves test readability and maintainability by keeping the test scripts concise and expressive. Additionally, the Page Object Design Pattern supports better organization of code, making it easier to manage and scale automated test suites. Overall, this pattern is instrumental in building robust and scalable UI automation frameworks.
